# Pet Daycare Simulation

## Overview

The **Pet Daycare Simulation** is a computer program designed to model the operations of a real-world pet daycare center. This project aims to demonstrate and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by recreating basic functions and activities of a pet daycare in a virtual environment.

### Key Features

- **Virtual Pets**: Simulates pets with attributes such as name, age, and type (e.g., dog, cat).
- **Virtual Caretakers**: Models the staff responsible for caring for the pets.
- **Virtual Activities**: Includes actions like feeding, playing, and napping for pets.
- **Time Simulation**: Simulates the passage of time within a daycare day.
- **Check-in/Check-out System**: Manages the process of pets entering and leaving the daycare.

### Objectives

- **Design and Implement Classes**: Create classes to represent pets, caretakers, and other components.
- **Object Interaction**: Make objects interact in ways that mimic real-world relationships.
- **Inheritance**: Use inheritance to create specialized types of pets.
- **Practical Application**: Apply OOP concepts in a relatable, real-world scenario.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pet-daycare-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd pet-daycare-simulation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Follow any additional instructions in the `requirements.txt` or `package.json` file if there are dependencies.

4. **Run the Simulation**

   Instructions for running the simulation will vary based on the programming language used. For example:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   or 

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
